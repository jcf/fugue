# fugue

These icons aren't my work, I've just put them in a Git repo to be used
with submodules as I find myself chucking these icons in to a lot of my
projects.

The README distributed within the icon set is pasted below.

## Installation

If you're using Rails you could use something like the command below to
get all these icon files available within `images/fam3`

    git submodule add git://github.com/jcf/fugue.git public/images/fugue

Probably not a good idea to link to the images directly. That would be
lame of you.

## Other Icon Sets

I've also created a couple of other Git repos with the FamFamFam and
Fugue shadowless icons.

1. [FamFamFam][fam3]
2. [Fugue Shadowless][fugue_shadowless]
